# py_ped_sim - A flexible forward pedigree and genetic simulator for complex family pedigree analysis

![plot](test_data/images/Fig1.jpg)

# Overview
`py_ped_sim` 
**This code is by Miguel Guardado mostly, I added script for work with multiple chromosomes and described the process of genome simulation on the basis of pedigree structure. If you're interested in it, you can go to file named 'README_Pedigree simulation with offspring genome generation.txt'**



We have developed a python command-line-based tool called py_ped_sim that facilitates the simulation of pedigree 
structures and the genomes of individuals in a pedigree. py_ped_sim represents pedigrees as directed acyclic graphs, 
enabling conversion between standard pedigree formats and integration with the forward population genetic simulator, SLiM. 
Notably, py_ped_sim allows the simulation of varying numbers of offspring for a set of parents, with the capacity to 
shift the distribution of sibship sizes over generations. We additionally add simulations for events of 
misattributed paternity, which offers a way to simulate half-sibling relationships. 


This command line tool was developed with a python front end and uses SLiM as a forward genetic simulator to simulate genetic variance on non founders.
This software leverages family pedigrees as directed acyclic graph data structures where nodes represent individuals 
and directed edges represent parent-child relationships. While the input must be specified as [networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html#directed-graphs)
directed graph, you can additionally convert a standard ped file to a networkx based pedigree with this software.
 
Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions or suggestions 
I can create to make this code more useable! Miguel.Guardado@ucsf.edu

## Overview of Features

### Core Features

`sim_ped` - Simulate a pedigree structure based on inputs of sibship distributions across generations. 
User can specify their own distributions or use the default distributions provided by US Census (IPUMs)

`sim_map` - Simulate events of Misattributed Paternity, where someone who is presumed to be the individuals father is in fact not the biological father. 
User can specify how often this event will happen in the pedigree, in addition to how often the new biological father is within the family, or a new individual. 

`sim_genomes` - Simulate genomes based on a fixed pedigree structure. Genetic simulations are preformed within SLiM. Genomes are outputted to the user within a VCF file

`enur_fam` - This feature will determine all pairwise relationships within a family pedigree via 3 statistics. 
Meiosis Count, Generation Depth Difference, and Relation Type.

`run_full_family_broadening` - Simulate families on non-root founders on the main family. New joint family is outputted as a directed graph as a NX file. 
A corisponding profiles file will also be generated containing ID, SEX, and Generation.

### Supplemental Features
`sim_founders` - This feature utilizes MSPrime to simulate genomes for founders initalization. 

`ped_to_networkx` - This is a helper function that is used to convert a standard pedigree (__.ped__) file into a networkx (__.nx__)  based family pedigree.

`networkx_to_ped` - This is a helper function that is used to convert a networkx based pedigree (__.nx__) file into a standard pedigree (__.ped__) file.

`check_founder` - This function is used return the meta information of the networkx pedigree, it will return the 
number of founders, num of implicit founders, and num of descendants inside the family.

`filter_vcf` - This function will filter vcf files for only bi-allelic SNPs. This function is an important preprocessing
step for VCF Files before genome simulations can be preformed in SLiM. Additionally it will create an info column for
the ancestral allele for each SNP, as is a requirement for inputting vcf files into SLiM. 

`fill_ped` - Fill in missing pedigree information for implicit founders (individuals where only one parent is defined)

`convert_pedigree` - This will preform the wrapper script to convert networkx-represented pedigrees into SLiM readable pedigree files. 
This function will only return you the SLiM readable pedigree file for mostly debugging purposes. 

`run_single_family_broadening` - this function creates a connection between two families at a specified individual in the main family. 

## Basic Definitions 
Founders - Founders are defined as individuals who do not have any known ascendants. Explicit founders are classified 
as individuals who are defined in the pedigree. Implicit founders are defined in the case of incomplete pedigrees, 
when only on one parent is known for a descendants. Since our simulations need both parents to simulate the 
offspring, we refer to the missing parent as an implicit founder. My software is able to handle events of implicit founders, 
as long as you provide a genome for them inside the vcf file.

# Tutorial / Getting Started 

## Install Conda Environment
You will need to have conda installed on your system. To install conda/mini conda onto your system follow this 
[link](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Once you have conda installed on your system, check its working by the simple command
```bash
conda info
```

This repo includes a `ped_sim.yml` file that includes a virtual conda environment of all the software that is needed. 
Once you clone the repo to you directory, create and load the conda environment as follows.

```
cd ped_sim
conda env create -f ped_sim_env.yml
conda activate ped_sim
python setup.py install

#check pipeline interface is working though run_ped_sim.py
python run_ped_sim.py -h
```
For each of the simulation preformed in here you must specify the type of simulation you want preformed. This will be done
by the `-t` parameter. This parameter is **necessary** for any simulation preformed, or else the software will break.

Each feature of the software must be specified with the `-t` parameter. This parameter is **necessary** for any 
simulation preformed, or else the software will not run.

## Preforming genomic simulations of a pedigree

### Simulate Founders
If you already have a vcf of founders this step can be skipped. If you do not have empirical genomes this function will use
MSPrime (already installed in conda enviroment) to simulate genomes under a constant demographic model.

For example, lets simulate 1000 individuals genomes using a starting population of 10000 individuals, using a genome length of 100KB

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_founders -l 100000 -Ne 100000 -Nf 1000 -mu 1e-7 -r 1e-08 -o tmp_founder
```

### Founder VCF Set Up
**Note that VCF files must only have bi-allelic SNPs and have the ancestral allele information (AA) defined to input into SLiM**

To ensure your VCF file is set up correctly, you can use filter_vcf before running genomic simulations

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t filter_vcf -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata.vcf
```

### Set up Networkx File
One of the required inputs is a networx file describing the pedigree that the genomes will be simulated onto. 
if you already have a pedigree file the ped_to_networkx feature can be used to convert it into networx format. 

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t ped_to_networkx -p test_data/test_fam.ped -o test_data/test_fam
```

### Check Founders
To check that the founders in the pedigree are as expected you can run the following command 

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t check_founders -n test_data/test_fam.nx
```
### Simulate Genomes onto Pedigree

Now that you have all of the required input files you are ready to simulate genomes onto the pedigree! This can be
preformed by either selecting founders from the input vcf (sim_genomes) or by explicitly assigning genomes to the founders 
(sim_genomes_exact). Here are examples of each. 

#### Assigning founders randomly
```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_genomes -n test_data/test_fam.nx -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata_slim_fil.vcf -o testfam_exact
```


#### Explicitly assigning genomes to founders 
```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_genomes_exact -n test_data/test_fam.nx -e test_data/exact_founder_input.txt -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata_slim_fil.vcf -o testfam_exact
```

### Simualte Genomes under nucleotide specific simualtions
Note that the resulting VCF file will not be aligned to the genome that the user inputs for founder initialization. 
For example if the user input a genome from the second chromosome the outputted vcf will default output as the first 
chromosome. Also the position of each SNP will be lost and defults to a SNP with a Ref of A and alt of T. 
If it is important to have the same chromosome outputted, you can use the -f which will require a fasta input to your SLiM simulations when running sim_genomes or sim_genomes_exact. 

```bash 
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_genomes -f test_data/test_fam_fasta.fa -n test_data/test_fam.nx -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata_slim_fil.vcf -o testfam_exact
```

### Simulate Genomes with a Recombination Map 
Recombination maps are important if you care about varying the rate of recombination along a genome. We provide the users the 
flexibility to enter recombination maps when's simulating genomes onto pedigrees. This feature can be used in tandem with
nucleotide specific simulations. 

**You must specify the `-rm` parameter to run simulations with recombination maps**

```bash 
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_genomes_exact -n test_data/test_fam.nx -rm test_data/test_fam_recomb_map.txt -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata_slim_fil.vcf -o testfam_exact
```

Format of the recombination maps should be a two columns file, TAB delimited with no columns. The first columns represents
the start point of position in bases, beggining with 1, the second column is the recombination rate for that region 
in cM/Mbp. When you input a number, it will be converted to scientific notation with an exponent of -8 for use in SLiM. 
For example, if you input 1.8, it will be interpreted as 1.8e-8.

**Example format of file:**

| 1     | 0    |
|-------|------|
| 3000  | 1.8  |
| 4503  | 1.6  |



### sim_ped - Pedigree Structure Simulator 

This feature will simulate pedigree structures with non-uniform rates of sibship size across generations. 
This will not produce genomes but rather pedigree structures themselves. Output of formats will be represented 
by networkx formatted pedigrees. Additionally, a profiles fill will be outputted recording the sex and generation
each individual is assigned to


```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_ped -y 1880 1900 1920 -o 3gen_family 
```

Parameter list 

`-c` - sibship distribution file , default to scripts/ipumps_sibship_dist.txt

`-y` - years to sample from census filepath. Years used must be found inside -c

`-s` - random seed to sample from

`-o` - output prefix 

Format of sibship distribtion:

| Year | Mean | SD   |
|------|------|------|
| 1850 | 3.31 | 2.13 |
| 1860 | 3.11 | 2.00 |
| 1870 | 2.97 | 1.94 |
 This data was estimated from IPUMs

Output of the simulation will be a family pedigree represented as a networkx directed graph and a profiles
file of the genome simulations 

### sim_map - Misattributed Paternity Simulator

This feature will preform misattributed paternity simulation on existing pedigrees. Pedigrees must be in networkx file 
formats. This features will traverse through all non-root founders and identify  

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_map -n test_data/test_fam.nx -pr test_fam_profiles.txt -p1 0.10 -p2 0.50 -o test_data/test_fam_wmp 
```
This will MAP simulation with a MP rate of 0.10 and a within family MP event rate of 0.50

Parameter list 

`-n` - networkx represented pedigree file

`-pr` - profiles file for the network represented pedigree 

`-p1` - probability value on if a misattributed event will happen for a non-root founder

`-p2` - probability value on if the new parent will occur within the family

`-o` - output prefix 

### enur_fam - pairwise relationship identifier 

This feature will allow user to identify pairwise relationships for a specified family pedigree. This will
generalize these relationships into 3 metrics. Pairwise relationships, Meiosis Count, and Relationship Type. For a subset
of commonly known relationships, we will provide a relationship code of the relationship based on those three values.

ex. MC=1, GD=1, RT=Direct, RC=Parent Child
MC=2, GD=0, RT=Full, RC=Full Sibling
MC=2, GD=0, RT=Half, RC=Half Sibling

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t enur_fam -n test_data/test_fam.nx 
```

Additionally, you could only be interested in identifying relationships from a subset of individuals within a family 
pedigree. Users are able to input a text file of the ID's they wish to identify relationships for. Note this will
still find relationships for all other individuals for the subsetted individuals requested. 

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t enur_fam -n test_data/test_fam.nx -sf test_data/test_fam_sample.txt
```

`-n` - networkx represented pedigree file

`-sf` - single column file of individuals to idenitfy relationships for   

`-o` - output prefix for relationship file. **not required** 

### run_full_family_broadening - family broadening 

This feature will create simulated familes and attach them to non-root founders. 
If suplying with own main family, -y flag needs to exclude root founder generation and include last generation.

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t run_full_family_broadening -y 1850 1860 1870
```
This will simulate a main family then create joint families to connect to non-root founders in the main family.

Parameter list

`-c` - sibship distribution file, default to scripts/ipumps_sibship_dist.txt

`-y` - years to sample from census filepath. Years used must be found inside -c

`-o` - output prefix

`mf` - main family file. Use for when user has specified main family file

`mo` - main family output prefix. This is for the file name for the main family before family broadening.

# Feature documentation

### sim_founder 
This feature will initialize the founders genome by running an additional genetic simulation prior to the main
family simulation. This feature should be used in the event that you do not have empirical genomes to initalize for
`sim_genomes`. This feature is a simple implementation of a constant demographic model within MSPrime.
If you are using the conda enviroment, msprime will be installed for use. 

####  Input parameters 

`-t sim_founder`

`-l` - networkx represented family pedigree

`-Ne` - number of individals to simulate in the demographic

`-Nf` - number of founders to sample, this number is how many individuals are outputted in the vcf file

`-mu` - mutation rate for the simulation

`-r` - recombination rate for the simulation

`-o` - output prefix of the file

#### Example use
This simulations will simulate 1000 individuals genomes using a starting population of 100000 indiviuals, using 
a genome length of 100KB.

```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_founders -l 100000 -Ne 100000 -Nf 1000 -mu 1e-7 -r 1e-08 -o tmp_founder
```

### sim_genome and sim_genome_exact

This will simulate genomes onto fixed pedigrees. Genomic simulations of pedigree is done in SLiM. Primarily our feature
is a wrapper that transforms the pedigree into a format that SLiM can read for the genomic simulations. An important 
step of this feature is assigning the founders from a user inputted vcf file to the founders in the genomic simulations,
you can either do it randomly (sim_genomes) or explicitly assigning genomes to founders (sim_genomes_exact).

Simulated genomes get outputted as VCF files. 

The user will specify the output prefix of the simulations results output file name via the `-o` user parameter.

**Note that VCF files must only have bi-allelic SNPs and have the ancestral allele information (AA) defined to input into SLiM**

**PLEASE preprocess your vcf file with `filter_vcf` before running genomic simulations.**

**Note that the resulting VCF file will not be aligned to the genome that the user inputs for founder initialization. For example if
the user input a genome from the second chromosome the outputted vcf will default output as the first chromosome. If it is important 
to have the same chromosome outputted, please look into our nucleotide specific simulations `-f` which will require a fasta input 
to your SLiM simulations.**

#### Required input parameters
`-t sim_genomes` or 
`-t sim_genomes_exact`

`-n` - networkx represented family pedigree

`-v` - vcf file for founder genome initialization

`-o` - output prefix of the file

`-e` - exact founder table (space delimited table with 2 columns [vcf_id, founder_id], refer to `test_data/exact_founder_input.txt`)

#### Additional parameters
`-f` - fasta file for the inputted vcf file, this will activate nucleotide specifc simulations

`-r` - recombination rate to use for founder initialization + simulations (default = 1e-8)

`-mu` - mutation rate to use founder initialization + simulations (default = 1e-8)

`-s` - Seed number to use for the genetic simulation (default = 1)

#### Output
`{output_prefix}_genomes.vcf` - Genetic file of the family simulation. Input is presented as VCF format, information about vcf_file can
be found [here](https://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-40/) 

`{output_prefix}_slim_pedigree.txt` - This will output the slim readable pedigree output that is read into SLiM for the genetic simulations.
The file looks similar to a ped file, but the columns for each file will be [Generation, Offsrping, Parent1, Parent2].


#### Example Usage to Assign Individuals Randomly (sim_genomes)
```bash
#Filter VCF to only include bi-allelic SNPs
python run_ped_sim.py -t filter_vcf -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata.vcf

# Simulate Genomes onto pedigree using filtered vcf for founder initalization
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_genomes -n test_data/test_fam.nx -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata_slim_fil.vcf -o testfam
```

#### Example Usage to Assign Individuals using specific individuals in a VCF file (sim_genomes_exact)
```bash
python run_ped_sim.py -t sim_genomes_exact -n test_data/test_fam.nx -e test_data/exact_founder_input.txt -v test_data/lwk_1kg_toydata_slim_fil.vcf -o testfam_exact
